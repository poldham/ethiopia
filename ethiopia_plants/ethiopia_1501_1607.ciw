DE biodiversity; conservation; endemic species; floristic composition
AB The vegetation of the Gara Muleta and Kundudo mountains in Ethiopia conserves soil, water and both plant and animal diversity. It is under severe pressure of destruction caused by deforestation, fire, agriculture and overgrazing. The results of floristic studies revealed that there are more than 361 species of vascular plants representing 82 families at Gara Muleta and 96 species representing 43 families at Kundudo mountains. Out of the species recorded from Gara Muleta 45 (13%) are endemic to Ethiopia while 38 (11%) are nearly endemic. There are 6 (6%) endemic species at Kundudo mountain. The floristic composition of the two mountains was compared with the floristic composition of five mountain areas (Bale, Gara Ades, Menagesha, Semien and Wof-Washa mountains) in the country and with Afro-alpine areas in East Africa (Kenya, Rwanda-Burundi, Tanzania, Uganda and Zaire) and Usambara mountains. The highest similarity in floristic composition was obtained with Wof-Washa natural forest in both Gara Muleta (39%) and Kundudo (41%) suggesting that the flora in these mountains has some distinctive features. If the present trend of destruction continues the consequence will be many-fold, among which loss of biodiversity is one. Therefore, it is strongly recommended that these areas be afforded all possible protection before it is too late.

AB Up to 100 single plant derived lines of 18 Ethiopian barley landraces were evaluated for infection type in the seedling and adult plant stage, and for latent period in the adult plant stage only. A low infection type indicates the presence of race-specific resistance genes of the hypersensitive type, while the latent period is the major component of the polygenic, partial resistance.
   In the seedling stage 1721 of these single plant derived landrace lines were assessed for infection type against two barley leaf rust races. In the adult plant stage 1227 from these 1721 lines were evaluated for infection type against one race. In the seedling stage 2 (against race 1-2-1) and 29 against race A) out of the 1721 lines showed an infection type lower than 6-7 on the 0 to 9 scale. In the adult plant stage none of the 1227 lines had an infection type lower than 6-7 against race 1-2-1.
   The variation between and within the landraces for latent period in the adult plant stage was large. Some landraces such as landrace 212845 showed a highly significant and longer mean latent period than most other landraces. Virtually all plants in all landraces carry at least some partial resistance.
   The near-absence of race-specific, major, resistance genes and the high frequency of moderate levels of partial resistance indicates that the durability of leaf rust resistance in Ethiopian barley landraces is due to the latter type of resistance, and that the multiline principle does not operate.

AB The Aluto-Langano Geothermal Pilot Plant will be the first geothermal power plant in Ethiopia. Its purpose is to utilise existing wells, drilled about a decade ago, to generate additional electricity for the power system and to prove the capability of the Aluto-Langano field to support expansion to 30 MWe. This paper discusses the evaluation of possible production wells, in combination with three power cycle options, leading to selection of a preferred development concept. Despite the small size of the pilot plant, the high elevation of the site, and the very high gas content of the field, a condensing unit was selected. Particular design features proposed for the steamfield and power plant are explained, including those that reflect the pilot plant nature of the project.

AB Perennial kale has probably been domesticated and distributed by the Romans. Some relic populations are still being grown in various parts of western Europe (Ireland, Scotland, England, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Portugal), in Ethiopia, in Brazil and Haiti up to the present.
   Most accessions of perennial kale grown in gardens in the Dutch province Limburg have lost their flowering ability. Some of them flower occasionally, others every year. No explanation can be given for this inconstant behaviour.
   This predominantly diploid material is quite uniform for the enzymes acid phosphatase (ACD), esterase (EST), glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (GOT) and shikamata dehydrogenase (SKD). The same is true for presence of anthocyanins in the leaves. The 40 fully investigated accessions could be grouped into 8 phenotypes: 26 with phenotype 1 (at least 9 are tetraploid), three with phenotype 2, six with phenotype 3, and one for each of the phenotypes 4 to 8. Accessions with phenotypes 2 and 3 had the same phenotype for the four enzymes as phenotype 1, and so have most of the 13 accessions, only investigated for enzymes.

AB The use of molluscicides of plant origin for the control of Schistosomiasis is attractive due to the economic advantage of cultivating the plants locally instead of importing synthetic chemicals. The most extensively studied plant molluscicide is one derived from the berries of Ended (Phytolacca dodecandra L'Herit), a plant indigenous to eastern, central, western and southern Africa. The attempts to widen the applications of this plant as a means of control Schistosomiasis in infected areas suffer from two disadvantages: its natural occurrence other than in Ethiopia is limited and its cultivated forms outside Ethiopia produced a low-yield of berries. It is also difficult to find the correct soil type, climate, etc.... outside those few areas where Ended grows naturally. In order to introduce a new natural molluscicidal source in Egypt, the seeds of Ended were obtained from Zambia and were subjected to germination and cultivation trials. The germination percentage of the seeds was very low (20%). This work aimed to propagate Ended by shoot tip culture and microcuttings technique. This is the first report on the micropropagation of Ended (Phytolacca dodecandra L'Herit) in Egypt.

AB The field experiment was conducted at Indian Agricultural Research Institute, New Delhi, during winter season (rabi) of 1989-90 and 1990-91 in a sandy-loam alluvial soil on Ethiopian mustard (Brassica carinata A. Braun) with 4 levels each of irrigation water : cumulative pan evaporation ratio (unirrigated control and irrigation at IW : CPE ratios of 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8) and nitrogen (0, 50, 100 and 150 kg/ka). The growth and yield attributes, seed and oil yields increased significantly only up to an IW : CPE ratio of 0.6 (2 irrigations). Nitrogen application improved the growth and yield attributes, and also the seed and oil yields significantly up to 100 kg N/ha, but harvested biomass up to 150 kg N/ha. Irrigation and N interacted significantly for plant height, total branches and siliquae/plant, harvested biological and seed yield. Significantly higher seed production (19.8 q/ha) and oil yield (7.7 9/ha) were obtained from the crop irrigated at an IW : CPE ratio of 0.6 fertilized with 100 kg N/ha, but biomass yield (83.3 q/ha) was highest with 150 kg N/ha at an IW : CPE ratio of 0.8.

AB In order to understand the nature and causes of chlorosis at Metahara Sugar Estate (8 degrees 53'N and 39 degrees 52'E) in Ethiopia, soil profile samples were collected from a ratoon field that exhibited chlorosis. From the same site, the first ratoon sugar cane leaf blades (+3) were sampled on the basis of the degree of chlorosis, and thus categorised into green, medium green, medium yellow and yellow. Soil sample analysis indicated that DTPA-extractable Fe, Mn and Cu were adequate for normal plant growth in spite of an increase in CaCO3 content. Moreover, the chlorotic leaves contained higher iron content than the green ones. Consequently, it is concluded that iron chlorosis of sugar cane at Metahara could be due to physiological inactivation of iron in soils and the plant.
   A field experiment was also conducted using sugar cane variety CO-449 in order to select the most effective iron source to control iron chlorosis of the plant. The plots received the treatments of FeSO4, EDDHA and DTPA at three different levels each as foliar sprays. The untreated plots were used as control. The chemicals were applied on the first ratoon 3 weeks after harvest, and repeated a week after the first spray. Twenty millable canes from the middle two rows were sampled at 12 months for yield and juice quality determinations. Iron sulphate spray at 15 kg ha(-1) increased cane length and commercial cane sugar by 33 and 44 % over the control, respectively. The highest cane yield was secured by spraying DTPA at 1.80 kg ha(-1) even though its recoverable sugar percentage was low. Not all sources of iron improved juice quality.
   Since FeSO4 at 15 kg ha(-1) was equally effective as the 30 kg ha(-1) FeSO4 applications, the need to consider other than the currently used rate in the Estate is timely and is very important.

DT Article
AB A total of 834 samples of local adapted maize germplasm were collected from eight administrative regions of Ethiopia; 592 samples in 1984 and 1985, 242 in 1986 and 1987. After collection, the accessions were evaluated at two experimental stations - Awasa and Zewai. Both stations are located in a semi-arid environment of southern Ethiopia where rainfall amount is low. In particular at Zewai, rainfall is poorly distributed and highly variable. Under these conditions, maturity indeces of germplasm from Welo, Game Gofa, Shewa and Hererge were early to medium. Accessions from Welega, Illubabor, Keffa, and Sidamo area were late types with an average growth period of more than 130 days. Data on maturity indeces, plant and ear height, disease and pest reaction, and yield performance revealed the diversity and variability of maize germplasm in Ethiopia. An experiment carried out during 1988 and 1990 under controlled conditions at Awasa indicated the potential and adaptability of unexploited Ethiopian maize germplasm as source material for the maize improvement under stress environments. Germplasm selected for early maturity, drought resistance, disease and pest tolerance, and yield were superior in most aspects compared to a new variety ready for release and a standard check which should further be assessed for trueness to type.

AB The soil seed bank was investigated in four dry Afromontane forests of Ethiopia. Al least 167 plant species were identified in the 0 - 9 cm soil layer with total densities ranging between 12 300 and 24 000 seeds/m(2) Herbs were represented with the largest numbers of species and seeds in the seed bank, while the contribution of tree species was rally low. The overall vertical distribution of seeds was similar at all sites with the highest densities occurring in the upper three cm of soil and gradually decreasing densities with increasing depth. Relatively high densities also occurred in the litter layer. There were large differences in depth distribution between species, suggesting differences in seed longevity. A large number of species in dry Afromontane forests evidently store quantities of seeds in the soil and this is in contrast to the situation in most tropical rain forests, dry lowland forests and savannas, where both the number of seeds and the number of species are relatively small. It is possible that the strongly seasonal and unpredictable climate of this region may have selected for high levels of dormancy, and that herb regeneration is associated with small scale disturbance. The fact that most of the dominant tree species do not accumulate seeds in the soil suggests that their regeneration from seed would be unlikely if mature individuals disappeared. Most tree species have relatively large seeds and poor long-distance dispersal; this implies that restoration of Afromontane forests after destruction would be difficult. Since there is a diverse seed bank of the ground flora, this component of the vegetation would have a better chance of re-establishing. However, because most cleared forest land is used for agricultural crop production, it is probable that the seed bank will be depleted in only a few years. Therefore, the future of the Afromontane forest flora seems to depend on the successful conservation of the few fragments of remaining natural forest.

AB Soil samples collected from two sites in Ethiopia yielded one new species, Discocriconemella addisababa sp. n., and four known plant parasitic nematode species: Criconemella parva (Raski, 1952) De Grisse and Loof, 1965; Paratylenchus leptus Raski, 1975; Scutellonema brevistyletum Siddiqi, 1972 and Helicotylenchus abunaamai Siddiqi, 1972. Discocriconemella addisababa sp. n. falls into ''group two'' of Vovlas' (1992) subdivision of the genus that comprises another seven species with a characteristic dorsally and ventrally indented labial disc. The new species differs from the others in a combination of characters: stylet length, frequent anastomoses, total number of annuli (R = 84-104), fewer annuli posterior to vulva (RV = 5-9), retrorse body annuli, high value for the ratio ''c'' ( 31.3-46.7), long body (L = 323-420 mu m), rounded tail and absence of male. Paratylenchus leptus is reported here for the first time outside Brazil. Scanning electron micrographs of four species: Discocriconemella addisababa n, sp., Criconemella parva, Paratylenchus leptus and Scutellonema brevistyletum are also presented.

AB For the first time, plant-sociological investigations of the epiphytic bryophyte vegetation (''shade epiphyte synusia'' Richards 1952) has been carried out by the BRYOTROP III-project in central Africa (Zaire: Irangi Forest Station, Pare National de Kahuzi-Biega; Rwanda: Foret de Nyungwe) following a strong altitudinal gradient (850 m up to 3300 m) in distance of 200 m height. As a result, 11 new associations and 9 subassociations have been described, which can be classified synhierarchical within 4 new alliances (a Lejeuneo flavae-Plagiochilion salvadoricae of the tropical lowland belt, a mesohydrophytic Plagiochilion divergentis of the tropical-montane rain forest belt, a meso-xerophytic Plagiochilion squamulosae of the upper tropical-montane forest belt, a Plagiochilion colorantis of the tropical-subalpine ericaceous formations and of the tropical-alpine Subparamo vegetation). The vertical zonation of these communities is comparable to the ecological zonation and corresponds with the forest formations of the area. It is influenced mainly by the temperature and humidity conditions, the structure, different layers, density and status (primary or secondary forests) of the various forest communities, the structure of the bark and the age of the phorophyte. The epiphytic communities of the tropical-subalpine and the tropical-alpine belt are floristical and ecological quite different from the communities of the rain forests (eastern Congo-basin). They already are related to the communities of the woodlands and dry forests of eastern Africa and the Ethiopian Highlands.

AB Crop growth and disease epidemics in sprayed and non-sprayed bean plots, artificially infected with rust (Uromyces appendiculatus) 3 weeks after emergence, were assessed weekly in two cultivars, at two locations for two seasons. Disease intensity was regulated by the application of a fungicide at 5 spray frequencies. Fungicide application influenced leaf area index (LAI) and reduced rust intensity. The fungicide had no significant effect on other diseases and dead leaf area. Fungicide application increased seed yield (SY) by increased numbers of pods per plant (PP). Rust severity was strongly correlated with pustule density but the overall relationships among rust assessment parameters depended on cultivar and location. Seed yield and pods per plant were highly correlated with LAI. The relationships between LAI and seeds per pod or seed weight depended on cultivar and location. Overall rust assessment parameters (rust severity and pustule density) showed close, negative relationships with seed yield, seed weight and pods per plant but not with seeds per pod. The relationships obtained in the partially resistant line 6-R-395 were less definite than those in the susceptible line Mexican 142. The yield parameters seed yield and pods per plant showed strong positive relationships.

AB The amount and nutritive value of forage plants, diet composition, digestibility of dry matter and nutrients were recorded for zebra, Grant's gazelle, Swayne's hartebeest and hippopotamus in November-December 1991. Besides, daily egest of feces, the level of food and nutrient consumption, energy and protein requirements were recorded for zebra and Grant's gazelle. The digestibility of pasture forage was determined as a ratio of lignin concentration in food to the concentration in feces (lignin tracer technique), a daily intake was calculated on the basis of the daily feces egest. Protein percentage in the diet of zebra and hartebeest consuming dry parts of grasses did not exceed 5%. Gazelle diet consists of green parts of plants and included 18% of protein. The digestibility of dry matter in nonruminants (zebra, hippopotamus) was 40-45%, in hartebeest - 50%,in gazelle - 60%. Due to the abundance of dry grasses (3.7 ton ha(-1)) the daily food consumption of zebra was high - 7.2 kg ind(-1) (dry weight), the metabolizable energy intake (ME) being 51 MJ. Adult gazelles consumed 1.5-2.5 kg ind(-1) of food and 14-24 MJ of ME. The energy requirements of adult males and non-lactating females of zebras and gazelles (48 and 13 MJ respectively) were met, the energy balance being negative for lactating animals. The daily protein requirement was not met in zebra (392-704 g ind(-1) vs 134 g ind(-1) of intake) and in lactating gazelles (250 g ind(-1) vs 197 g ind(-1)). Non-lactating gazelles consume sufficient amount of both energy and protein due to the high feeding selectivity of the species and thanks to the abundance of burnt areas with young green after-grass in the dry period.

AB Radial expansion of foci in mixtures of susceptible and resistant bean cultivars was studied at two sites in Ethiopia. The foci expanded in a wave-like fashion. At Ambo (1990), radial expansion velocity ranged from 6 cm per day in mixtures with 20% susceptible plants to 15 cm per day in plots with the susceptible plants only. At Debre Zeit, the velocity ranged from 3 cm per day in a mixture with 20% susceptible plants to 16 cm per day in plots with 100% susceptible plants. At both sites the radial expansion velocity of foci correlated linearly with the logarithm of the fraction of susceptible plants in the mixture. Velocities of focus expansion at Ambo and Debre Zeit were approximately equal in plots consisting of susceptible plants only. At lower proportions of susceptible plants the velocities at Debre Zeit were lower than at Ambo. Indications were given as to the environmental factors responsible for the observed difference between sites. At each site, the variation between plots showed a clear spatial pattern, probably due to environmental factors.

TI YIELD GAIN AND RISK MINIMIZATION IN MAIZE (ZEA-MAYS) THROUGH CULTIVAR
   MIXTURES IN SEMIARID ZONES OF THE RIFT-VALLEY IN ETHIOPIA
SO EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE
LA English
DT Article
AB The effect of mixtures of cultivars on yield and risk distribution in four maize cultivars grown at four different population levels was studied in semi-arid environments in Ethiopia. Mixtures yielded between 2 and 29% more than the pure stands, but late maturing pure stands produced more biomass than mixtures. Mixtures of cultivars with similar flowering periods yielded 60% more than the pure stands in dry growing seasons, but only 30% more when there was more rain. Yield gain was associated mainly with varietal synchrony of anthesis and silking. Mixtures scomposed of cultivars with different flowering times were less at risk from yield loss in the case of end-of-season drought and yielded 100% more than their late flowering component in pure stand. But in long growing seasons, with an early dry spell, pure stands of the late cultivar outyielded the mixtures whereas pure stands of the early flowering cultivars yielded less than the mixtures, except in years with a serious end-of-season drought. The results indicate that it would be profitable to grow mixtures in semi-arid regions if cultivars with similar height and synchronized flowering time were grown at populations of between 65 000 and 90 000 plants ha(-1).

AB Clonal material from an imported Ethiopian cultivar (E44) and a local Zimbabwean cultivar (MSI) of the molluscicidal berry plant, Phytolacca dodecandra, was planted in eight ecological zones of Zimbabwe to assess the influence of different climatic and edaphic conditions on plant growth performance, berry yield, saponin content, and the molluscicidal potency of water extracts of the berries. The locations were at altitudes ranging from 429 m to 1650 m above sea level and were chosen to represent the major ecological regions where the plant molluscicide would be required. The highest berry yield of 1057 g per plant was obtained from the Ethiopian cultivar cultivated at an altitude of 1650 m while the highest berry yield from the Zimbabwean cultivar was 683 g per plant at an altitude of 1100 m. Saponin content and molluscidical potency of berry extracts from the Ethiopian plants cultivated at all localities were higher than the Zimbabwean cultivar (P < 0.01). This indicated the greater ecological adaptability of the Ethiopian variety for use in schistosomiasis control programmes. The addition of cattle manure at planting reduced the nutrient differences in inherent soil chemical properties on berry saponin content and molluscicidal potency. Regular irrigation during the study period prevented the previously demonstrated water stress related increase in saponin content and potency of the berries from low rainfall areas. Saponin yield was highest (212 g per plant) in the Ethiopian cultivar at high altitudes. In lowland areas, however, this was highest for the Zimbabwean cultivar, notwithstanding the good growth of the Ethiopian cultivar.

TI PERFORMANCE, FEED QUALITY AND P-RESPONSE OF LEUCAENA AND CALLIANDRA
   SPECIES GROWN AS HEDGEROWS ON AN ACIDIC NITOSOL AT SODDO, ETHIOPIA
SO TROPICAL GRASSLANDS
LA English
DT Article
AB Eleven accessions taken from Leucaena leucocephala, L. revoluta, L. pallida, L. diversifolia and L. leucocephala x L.diversifolia hybrids (leucaena); together with 3 accessions of Calliandra calothyrsus (calliandra), were evaluated on an acidic, nitosol soil in the tropical highland region of Soddo in southern Ethiopia for dry matter production, feed quality, soil fertility and responses to phosphorus fertilisation.
   At the first harvest (11 months after transplanting), over all accessions and for individual accessions, plant height, spread, basal stem diameter and dry matter yield showed significant responses to the application of phosphorus (P). There was also a significant interaction between accessions and P treatments for most of these growth parameters. Two regrowth harvests showed a significant response in dry matter production of both leaf + soft stem and hard-stem fractions to the application of phosphorus (P).
   L. leucocephala accessions had higher in vitro dry matter digestibility (IVDMD) values than the other Leucaena spp. Two of the 3 C. calothyrsus accessions had significantly higher values for ash, NDF and ADF, lower IVDMD and slightly lower protein than all leucaena accessions.
   The clearly superior growth performance of the calliandras and the leucaenas, other than L. leucocephala, over that of cv. Peru (control), emphasises the need to evaluate their feed value in vivo and at the farm level. While already being used quite widely as a multi-purpose tree, calliandra has not been collected and researched much around the world as a forage species. There seems to be considerable scope for the selection of productive and useful lines of calliandra and L. diversifolia, L. pallida, L. revoluta and some of their hybrids for the cooler tropical highlands, for acidic soils and for potential psyllid resistance.

AB All cultivated varieties of Coffea arabica in Central America are susceptible to local populations of root-knot nematodes, belonging to the Meloidogyne genus. Chemical control of this important coffee pest is expensive and not always efficient, therefore genetic solutions are to be envisaged. So far, only unselected populations of c. canephora have been used in some areas in Central America as root-stocks for C. arabica varieties. The objective of this paper is to present recent results of the PROMECAFE breeding programme. The genetic material evaluated comprised C. canephora progenies, C. arabica accessions from Ethiopia and progenies derived from the hybrids of Timer (Catimor, Sarchimor), as well as susceptible control varieties (Caturra, Catuai). Laboratory or field observations were carried out with regard to nematode populations from Guatemala, El Salvador and Costa Rica.
   The result show general susceptibility of most C. arabica accessions to nematodes from Costa Rica, whereas the same type of material had shown before high frequency of resistant plants to nematodes from Guatemala. With C. canephora, progenies were identified with high resistance to nematode populations from all three countries. Some Catimor and Sarchimor lines showed high resistance to nematodes from Costa Rica. These results suggest specific resistance responses with regard to nematodes from different countries. These differences seem to be related to the characteristic of the nematodes to form egg masses outside or inside the roots. Based on these observations strategies for breeding resistant root-stock varieties of C. canephora and seed varieties of C. arabica are proposed.

AB Browse is an important forage in pastoral systems, especially during dry seasons, because it is high in nitrogen and digestibility. However, browse palatability may be reduced by possible plant defenses such as tannins and physical attributes. Chemical and physical properties of 20 browse species were correlated with the feeding preference of camels, sheep and goats during wet and dry seasons in a densely wooded, semi-arid savanna. Preference was assessed by comparing relative use with abundance of browse species. Chemical components included nitrogen, available nitrogen, acid-detergent fibre, in vitro digestibility, total tannins and condensed tannins. Physical defenses included thorns, hooks, spines, and leaf surface properties. Animal preference was negatively related to chemical and physical defense factors, positively related to N content, and unrelated to fibre and digestibility with results depending on animal species and season. Understanding the physical and chemical factors which influence browse selectivity aids in identifying promising forage resources.

AB Guizotia scabra ssp. scabra plants grown from seeds originating from southwest Ethiopia were found to carry 1-4 and 1-6 B-chromosomes in root tip cells and pollen mother cells, respectively. The B-chromosomes were of three morphological types, being large in size with a median or submedian centromere or smaller in size with a likely median centromere. They are all numerically stable within and between root tips, but in most of the plants their numbers in the pollen mother cells were higher than in the roots. When single, a B-chromosome remained as a univalent. When two or more were present, they paired with one another, most frequently as bivalents, with chiasmata in one or both arms. They had a high frequency of normal segregation at anaphase I and subsequent stages of meiosis. After application of C-banding technique, the large B-chromosomes with a median centromere did not show C-bands.

AB Common and durum wheat populations obtained from Sweden and originally collected in Ethiopia were screened for resistance to stem rust and leaf rust. Resistant selections of common wheat were crossed and backcrossed with either stem rust susceptible RL6071, or leaf rust susceptible Thatcher. Genetic studies, based largely on tests of backcross F-2 families, showed that four of the selections had in common a recessive gene SrA. Plants with this gene were resistant (1(+) infection type) to all stem rust races tested. This gene was neither Sr26 nor Sr29. The resistance of other selections, based on tests with an array of rust isolates, was due to various combinations of Sr6, 8a, 9a, 9d, 9e, 11, 13, 30, and 36. One of the selections had linked genes, Lr19/Sr25. Another selection had a dominant gene for resistance (;1 infection type) to all the races of leaf rust. With the possible exception of this gene for leaf rust resistance and SrA, no obviously new resistance was found.

AB Opium poppy is one of the ancestral domesticated plants for humans. It is widely cultivated from the subtropical to the alpine regions, from Ethiopia to Scandinavia, Burma, Argentina and Tasmania, but it can escape from cultivation. Its wild subspecies setigerum has a natural area from Madeira to Cyprus, and around the Mediterranean sea.
   The species is of presumably triploid nature resulting in high genetic plasticity by the huge cultivation area, as well as its use as a medicinal, food, or ornamental plant.
   Poppy is differentiated in karyological (2n = 22, 44), morphological (shape and colour of petals, shape and size of capsules, colour of seeds etc.), physiological (length of life cycle, photoperiodic induction) and biosynthetic (main alkaloids, rate of seed oil) characters.
   This biodiversity must be reflected in the microsystematics of the species on behalf of horticulturalists, to select new cultivars on the basis of this giant genetical background, and to draw attention to the danger of the loss of this variability if not preserved in gene-banks.

AB Four durum wheat cultlvars (Triticum turgidum spp. durum Desf.) from different countries of origin (Austria, Ethiopia, and Italy) were investigated. Plants were grown in pots under glasshouse conditions. Immediately after the full development of the flag leaves, these leaves were detached for the screening. Distinct differences in water-retention capabilty among the cultivars was observed. The drought-resistant (hardy) types, Valgerardo and Boohai, showed better water retention capabilty than the drought-sensitive ones, such as D2-04-688. Poor yielding cultivars under field conditions were also found to be poor in water-retention capability and vice versa. The applied method is simple and inexpensive. It adds another procedure when screening for drought resistance. However, it needs further confirmation by cultivars covering a broader range of genetic diversity.

AB In Ethiopia almost 10 million people are dependent on ensete (Ensete ventricosum (Welw) Cheesman), also known as 'false banana'. In the Gurage area in Central Ethiopia, agronomic and nutritional aspects of ensete were studied in 60 households in six villages. Ensete is propagated vegetatively and has a 6-year growing cycle during which it is transplanted three or four times. Men harvest the plants; women scrape the pseudo stem in order to separate the starchy pulp from the fibre, and pulverise the corm. The pulp is fermented and stored for up to 5-7 years in earthen pits. The yield of ensete food (ko'cho) was found to be 34 kg per plant or 9.5 tons ha(-1) per year. Compared with other foods grown in Ethiopia, the energy yield of ensete (6.1 MJ m(-2) per year) was higher than that of all cereals, Irish potato, sweet potato and banana, but lower than that of cassava. The protein yield of ensete was higher (11.4 g m(-2) per year) than all of the crops mentioned above, except for banana and Irish potato. To make ensete bread, fermented pulp is squeezed to make it drier, chopped to shorten the fibres and a 2 cm layer is baked for 15 min. Unfermented freshly harvested corm is also eaten after boiling. All foods have a low protein content (4-22 g kg(-1)). Bu'lla, white desiccated juice collected from the pulp, is more energy rich (8.5 MJ kg(-1)) than ko'cho (6.5 MJ kg(-1)). A dietary survey, conducted in 39 households comprising 237 persons, showed that the average daily intake of 0.55 kg ensete provided 68% of total energy intake, 20% of protein, 28% of iron but no vitamin A. Energy intake from all food consumed was very low, being only 60% of requirements, while protein intake at 107% was ample. Since ensete can be stored for years, is readily available throughout the year and can withstand dry periods, its cultivation can significantly improve household food security in highland areas prone to drought and famine.

Palynostratigraphic and physical evidence of unconformities have been used to subdivide the pre-drift sediments into depositional cycles and to infer rifting events. A comparison with equivalent strata of Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia and Somalia shows a general correspondence and provides additional information for the construction of a generalized framework for the East African/Madagascan region which demonstrates the relationships between rifting and sedimentation and elucidates the prehistory of the break-up of Gondwana into a western and eastern fragment during the Middle Jurassic. The pre-drift succession of East Africa/Madagascar can be subdivided into two major sequences, a Karoo sequence (cycles 1 - 5, Asselian-early Smithian) and a transitional sequence (cycles 6 - 9, Ladinian - early Bajocian). The two sequences are separeted by a late Scythian to Anisian hiatus which indicates extensive uplift and erosion before a major rifting event initiated the resumption of sedimentation in the Ladinian. This Middle Triassic event marks the transition from the intracratonic rift stage to the pericratonic basin stage and correlates with a significant event in the Pangaean history, the transition from final coalescence to initial dispersal. The onset of the southward drift of Madagascar is believed to have occurred about 60 Ma later near the Aalenian-Bajocian boundary, contemporaneous with or immediately after the deposition of syntectonic sediments of cycle 9.

TI GENETIC-STUDIES ON HYBRID STERILITY IN BARLEY

ID RICE; JAPONICA; INDICA
AB Partially sterile F-1 barley plants were found when some Ethiopian varieties were crossed with Tayeh 1 (Chinese landrace), even though the parents were completely fertile. This hybrid sterility is shown to be controlled by two duplicate genes (sfg1 and sfg2). Because this gene interaction affects the female gamete only, the female gametes carrying the both sfg1 and sfg2 genes became sterile, the end result being that seed fertility of the F-1 plants is decreased to around 75%. Seed fertility was not significantly influenced by cytoplasms and genetic backgrounds of the F-1 plants, and years grown the F-1 plants.

AB A total of 210 extracts/fractions from 70 traditionally used Ethiopian plants were subjected to uterotonic acid antiimplantation bioassays. A total of 24% of the samples had uterotonic activity and 33% exhibited anti-implantation activity, while 13% had both uterotonic and anti-implantation activity. The percentage cumulative activity for aqueous, 95% ethanolic and n-butanolic extracts/fractions was 10%, 31% and 25%, respectively. The number of plants whose aqueous extracts, 95% ethanolic extracts and n-butanolic fractions had both uterotonic and anti-implantation activity were 2, 15 and 11, respectively. These findings tend to support traditional claims of antifertility activity for some of the herbs.

AB Genetic variability of cultivated and wild barley, Hordeum vulgare ssp. vulgare and spontaneum, respectively, was assessed by RFLP analysis. The material consisted of 13 European varietes, single-plant offspring lines of eight land races from Ethiopia and Nepal, and five accessions of ssp. spontaneum from Israel, Iran and Turkey. Seventeen out of twenty-one studied cDNA and gDNA probes distributed across all seven barley chromosomes revealed polymorphism when DNA was digested with one of four restriction enzymes. A tree based on genetic distances using frequencies of RFLP banding patterns was estimated and the barley lines clustered into five groups reflecting geographical origin. The geographical groups of land-race lines showed less intragroup variation than the geographical groups of spontaneum lines. The group of European varieties, representing large variation in agronomic traits, showed an intermediate level. The proportion of gene diversity residing among,geographical groups (F-ST) varied from 0.19 to 0.94 (average 0.54) per RFLP pattern, indicating large diversification between geographical groups.

AB The pattern of litterfall, its nutrient element content, rate of weight loss and release of nutrient elements were investigated in 28-40 year old plantations of two exotic species, Cupressus lusitanica and Eucalyptus globulus and one indigenous species, Juniperus procera, and compared with that of an adjacent Juniperus-Olea-Podocarpus montane forest in the Ethiopian highland. The total annual fine litterfall was 501 g m-2 year-1, 583 g m-2 year-1, 653 g m-1 year-1 and 1087 g M-2 year-1 in the C. lusitanica, Eucalyptus globulus, J. procera plantations and the natural forest, respectively: of this litterfall, leaves constituted 57.6%, 77.2%, 71.9% and 65.5%. Litterfall was higher in the natural forest than in any of the plantations in 18 of 24 months studied. It was generally high during the dry months and low during wetter months and varied between the 2 years of study. The concentration of nutrient elements in the litterfall to some extent showed a seasonal pattern, most pronounced for K.
   The four sites could be arranged in this sequence with respect to the rate of nutrient release from decomposing litter after 12 months: J. procera= C lusitanica > Eucalyptus globulus= natural forest. Nutrient elements and dry weight (DW) followed the release pattern: K > Mg > Ca > DW > N = P. After 24 months, the weight loss was less in the natural forest and C lusitanica site than in the Eucalyptus globulus and J. procera sites, with 11.8%, 10.6%, 7.2% and 4.6% remaining DW, respectively. The high N to P ratio in litter in the first phase and at the end of decomposition, or during the whole period in the case of Eucalyptus globulus, indicates that P was generally limiting for the decomposition.
   Owing to the lower amount of litter and its lower nutritional quality, the annual nutrient input by litter of the two exotics generally was much lower than that of J. procera and, in particular, that of the natural forest. A consequence of the less efficient within-stand cycling in the J. procera and natural forest sites may be that the herbs, shrubs and tree seedlings here may benefit more from nutrient elements released from litterfall than plants in the C lusitanica and Eucalyptus globulus sites.

AB Field studies on oviposition site, preference and pattern of Busseola fusca on various stages of maize were conducted at Awassa (southern Ethiopia). The positions of egg masses in terms of leaf sheath and height from the ground were described for different ages of the maize plant Irrespective of the age of maize plants, eggs were laid on the under side of leaf sheaths. Busseola fusca moths showed ovipositional preference to younger maize plants Significantly fewer egg masses were laid on older plants (r= -0.98, P < 0.001). A strong relationship between maize plant age and position of egg masses was found. During the post-tasselling stage the great majority of the egg masses were round below the primary ear.

DE ETHIOPIA; MEDICINAL PLANTS; TRADITIONAL MEDICINE; VETERINARY MEDICINE
AB The wide variety of traditional veterinary practices maintained within different ethnic groups provides an indication of the potential usefulness of this neglected knowledge for the Ethiopian livestock husbandry.
   In Ethiopia, as in other countries, traditional veterinary medicine involves the work of bone-setters, midwives, religious healers and people who claim the ability to communicate with devils. The knowledge of pastoralists in the areas of tick control, recognition of toxic plants, traditional surgery and traditional vaccination methods is described. Efforts by a Chinese veterinary team to promote traditional Ethiopian veterinary practices have been encouraging. Further evaluation of traditional veterinary practices is recommended as a condition for the integration of these practices with those of modern veterinary medicine. It is also suggested that this evaluation be coordinated and encouraged by the Veterinary Service of the Ministry of Agriculture in Ethiopia.

DE LENTIL; GERM PLASM; FLOWERING; TEMPERATURE; PHOTOPERIOD

AB A model to predict flowering time in diverse lentil genotypes grown under widely different photothermal conditions was developed in controlled environments. The present study evaluated that model with a world germ plasm collection of 369 accessions using two field environments in Syria and two in Pakistan. Photoperiod alone accounted for 69% of the variance in 1/f, the reciprocal of time (d) from sowing to flower. In contrast, temperature alone did not account for a significant proportion of variation in flowering time due to the exposure of plants to supra-optimal temperatures in the late-sown Syrian trial. With the model mean pre-flowering values of photoperiod and temperature combined additively to account for 90.3% of the variance of 1/f over accessions. The correlation of field-derived estimates of temperature sensitivity of accessions to glasshouse-derived estimates was significant at P = 0.05, but the equivalent correlation for estimates of photoperiodic sensitivity was higher at P < 0.01. Flowering in the field was better measured as time from sowing to 50% plants in flower rather than time to first bloom or its node number. Dissemination of the lentil crop following domestication in West Asia to the lower latitudes such as Ethiopia and India has depended on selection for intrinsic earliness and reduced sensitivity to photoperiod. Movement from West Asia to the higher latitudes accompanied by spring sowing has resulted in a modest reduction in photoperiod sensitivity and an increase in temperature sensitivity.

AB An experiment was conducted during 1988-91 to study the gene effects in interspecific crosses of indian mustard [Brassica juncea (L.) Czernj. & Cosson] x ethiopian mustard (Brassica carinata A. Braun). Analysis of generation means using data of parental and first 3 filial generations in 4 interspecific crosses of B. juncea x B. carinata showed predominance of additive gene action for number of primary branches, secondary branches, length of main fruiting branch, number of siliquae on main axis, seeds/siliqua, 1 000-seed weight and seed yield. Intermating of selected plants in early generation proved useful for i. Improvement of seed fertility. But simple pedigree or mass selection was found desirable in later generation for isolation of desirable recombinants.

AB The aim of the present study was to investigate with the N-15 natural abundance method if inoculation with vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi affects the N-2 fixation of legume trees grown under Ethiopian nursery conditions. A further aim was to test if VAM fungi influence the delta(15)N values of non-fixing plants.
   Five different VAM inocula and/or phosphorus fertilizer were applied to the standard, non-sterile nursery soil in which seedlings of four different Acacia species and Eucalyptus globulus were grown. After 3-5 months the acacia shoot dry weights and the fraction of the fine roots which were colonized VAM fungi was increased by four of the VAM inocula. However, inoculation did not influence the delta(15)N values of non-nodulated A nilotica or E. globulus; i.e., roots with low and high VAM colonization did not differ in discrimination against N-15. With E globulus used as a reference species grown under the same conditions and in the same time period as A. abyssinica, the N, fixation of A. abyssinica accounted for 5.1 to 46.7% of the seedling N content, dependent on the soil treatment. Deep shade reduced the N-2 fixation of A. abyssinica from 36.2 to 5.1%.
   The lower delta(15)N values of most VAM inoculated, nodulated acacias indicate that N, fixation was increased by those VAM fungi which also promoted shoot dry weight. However, VAM inoculation generally did not affect shoot N concentrations or nodule dry weights, and the delta(15)N values were not correlated with shoot N concentrations. N, fixation may not be important for the N nutrition and growth of seedlings in nutrient-rich nursery soils, but it is an important seedling property after outplanting in N deficient field soils.

DT Article
ID CARBON ASSIMILATION; SIMULATION
AB A spring wheat growth model (SUCROS-87) was used to identify moisture stress periods during the growing seasons and simulate yield potentials of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum var. durum) in six durum wheat growing regions of Ethiopia. The start of the rainy season and distribution of rainfall were erratic, particularly in the low-altitude regions. As a result, simulated dates of emergence varied from June to August. Moisture stresses of various intensities, at different growth stages of the plant, were limiting to durum wheat production in all the regions except Debre Markos. Terminal moisture stress was simulated in 7 out of 10 years in all locations except Debre Markos, whereas intermittent stress was simulated in three locations in 2 out of 10 years. In Metahara rain-fed durum wheat production is not feasible without irrigation. Water use efficiency decreased with decreasing rainfall but the transpiration coefficient increased. The aver age simulated potential grain yields at all the locations were high (6600 kg ha(-1)) compared with the actual national average. Development of versatile and region-specific improvement strategies are emphasized to improve durum wheat production in the country.

AB Phosphate sorption was studied in samples (0 - 20 cm depth) of five soils from Egypt (pH 7.4 - 8.7), four soils from Ethiopia (pH 3.9 - 5.3) and six soils from Germany (pH 3.3 - 7.2). Sorption parameters were calculated according to Pagel and Van Huay (1976) and according to Langmuir (Syers et al., 1973). Phosphate sorption parameters and oxalate extractable Fe and Al(Fe(ox), Al(ox)) were related to the phosphate uptake by young rye plants in Neubauer pot experiments.
   P sorption parameter after Pagel and Van Huay (A) correlated significantly positively with the Fe(ox), and Al(ox), content in acid (r = 0.73) as well as in calcareous soils (r = 0.89) if the whole equilibrium concentration range (0 - 14 mg P/L) was considered. The relations calculated after Langmuir (B) were similar.
   P uptake by rye in acid soils was negatively correlated with the affinity constant n (r = -0.76, (A)). In calcareous soils. a negative correlation between P uptake and affinity constant was calculated in the lower P equilibrium range (0 - 2.8 mg P/L) only for (B). Thus, P uptake decreased with increasing strength of P bonding to soil.
   From these results it is concluded that phosphate sorbed to Fe/Al oxides is an important P source for plants in acid and calcareous soils.

AB In order to elucidate ecological effects of plantation establishment in Ethiopia, soil physical and chemical characteristics, above-ground herbaceous biomass and nutrient content, fine root biomass and productivity and mycorrhizal colonisation were studied in a natural montane forest and in adjacent 28-40 year old plantations of the exotic species Cupressus lusitanica and Eucalyptus globulus and the indigenous Juniperus procera. The field studies were combined with bioassays of growth and nutrient uptake if Acacua abyssinica, Chloris virgata and Eragrostis tef in soils derived from each site.
   The Cupressus and Eucalyptus soils had lower nutrient content than Juniperus soil and that of the natural forest. The number of forbs and graminoids was high in all sites, but their coverage was poor in the Cupressus site. The production of fine roots in topsoil was twice as large in the Eucalyptus and Juniperus sites than in the other sites, whereas the standing crop of fine roots was higher in the Cupressus site. Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi were abundant in roots and soil of all sites. Their colonisation of roots of some of the most common forbs and graminoids was generally lower in the dry season than in the rainy season. In the bioassay, growth of Chloris virgata and Eragrostis tef was reduced in soil of all the plantations, most strongly in Eucalyptus sea, compared with their growth in soil of the natural forest.
   Nutrient concentration and pool sizes in herbaceous plants varied strongly between sites because of differences in species composition and herbaceous standing crop. Owing to the difference between herbaceous biomass harvested in the forest and biomass accumulation in the bioassay, it is suggested that vegetation and soil analyses are combined with bioassays in surveys of the fertility of soils after plantation establishment. The negative effect of Eucalyptus on the growth of Eragrostis tef in the bioassay should be considered when plans for future land use in Ethiopia are elaborated as respectively these are the most widely planted tree and crop species planted here.

AB This article introduces reports concerning the occurrence of mycorrhizae on epiphytes in Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Venezuela, Malaysia, and Mexico. Association of vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi with the roots of epiphytes is not well known. Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (VAM) do occur in the canopy, but are uncommon except in certain sites and host taxa. Occurrence of VAM on epiphytes may be constrained by mineral nutrient availability and spatial heterogeneity in the canopy. Nevertheless, epiphytes present unique opportunities to study influences of mycorrhizae on vascular plant community composition and on the evolution of mycorrhizal associations.

AB Roots of 28 species of epiphytic vascular plants were collected on tree trunks and branches at six afromontane forest sites between 1700 and 3300 m above sea level in Bale Mountains National Park, Ethiopia. Seven of the 28 epiphyte species were colonized by vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (VAM). Mycorrhizal colonization only occurred at two of the six sites examined, at 2900 m and 3300 m, but more than one type of VAM endophyte was present in each case. Three facultative epiphytic species were all highly colonized by VAM on the forest floor, whereas roots from epiphytic habitats were weakly colonized. No correlations were found between VAM colonization, fine root diameter and root hair length, but VAM colonization and root hair abundance were negatively correlated. The lack of VAM colonization of potential, epiphytic host species at the majority of the sites examined points to the dispersal of VAM propagules as the factor limiting mycorrhizal colonization of epiphytic habitats. It is suggested that root systems of hemiepiphytic tree species serve as corridors between forest floor and tree trunks through which VAM may spread via hyphal growth.

AB The effects of (NH4)2SO4, CO(NH2)2, Ca(NO3)2 and blood meal on the amount of available P released to barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) from Marocco rock phosphate (RP) and monocalcium phosphate (MCP), applied to slightly acid soils from Holetta, Jima (Ethiopia) and Pettenbrunn (Germany) were studied under greenhouse conditions. When the sparsely soluble P-source (RP) was used, application of (NH4)2SO4 gave the highest dry matter yield and P-uptake. When the soluble P-source (MCP) was used, no significant effect of N-form on P-uptake or dry matter yield of plants was observed, although (NH4)2SO4 and CO(NH2)2 applications decreased the pH of the soils as when applied with RP. The increased P-uptake due to (NH4)2SO4 application appears to have resulted both from soil acidification and increased plant growth.
   When N was applied as (NH4)2SO4 together with either RP or MCP remarkable pH decreases on all the soils were observed. Although not so pronounced as (NH4)2SO4, CO(NH2)2 and blood meal when applied with either P-sources had also a pH decreasing effect on all the three soils. Unlike to the other N-sources, Ca(NO3)2 increased the pH of each of the soils when applied with either P-sources.
   The residual P including root residues had no effect on the dry matter yield and P-uptake of maize (second crop), except on Pettenbrunn soil, which contained less P-fixing components (Fe- and Al-oxides) as compared with that of Holetta or Jima.
   Fractionation of phosphorus carried out at the end of the experiment showed that the major part of the applied phosphorus, that was not taken up by the plant, was transformed to a larger extent to difficultly soluble Fe- and Al-P and to a smaller extent to Ca-P forms.

AB Resistance to white lupin mosaic virus (WLMV), a recently characterized member of the potyvirus group, was found in pea (Pisum sativum L.) plant introductions from Ethiopia (PI 193835) and India (PI 347485). In cross and backcross populations between plants of resistant PI 193835 with those of susceptible 'Bonneville' and PP-492-5, this resistance was demonstrated to be governed by a single recessive gene. This gene was distinct from other genes previously found in PI 193835 and PP-492-5 (from PI 347492, India) conferring resistance to clover yellow vein virus (CYVV) and three strains of pea seedborne mosaic virus (PSbMV). Indirect evidence suggests that this newly recognized viral resistance gene, wlv, is a member of a cluster of closely linked genes located on chromosome 6. This gene cluster includes sbm-1, sbm-3, and sbm-4, which govern resistance to three PSbMV pathotypes, and cyv-2, which governs resistance to CYVV.

AB Condensed tannins in birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.) have been detected, but not quantified extensively. The objective of this study was quantitative analysis of tannins in birdsfoot trefoil germplasm. Diverse accessions were evaluated at two locations and on three harvest dates, and their tissues were analyzed by near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS), an accurate and efficient procedure increasingly used in quantitative germplasm evaluation. Ninety-seven diverse accessions of L. corniculatus were obtained from the USDA Northeast Regional Plant Introduction Station at Geneva, N.Y. Seedlings were transplanted to fields near Columbia and Mt. Vernon, MO. Herbage regrowth was harvested three times at 30-d intervals, lyophilized, and analyzed for total condensed tannins. Treatments were arranged in a split-plot design at two locations with accessions as main plots and harvest dates as sub-plots. Treatment combinations were replicated three times. Accessions were clustered according to the single variable, tannin concentration, by the Scott-Knott non-overlapping means separation technique. Performance mean and standard error of NIRS equations were 51.0 and 11.0 g catechin equivalents (CE) kg-1 dry matter (DM), respectively; NIRS squared correlation coefficients exceeded 0.90. Condensed tannins different (P < 0.01) among accessions and harvest dates, and an accession x harvest date interaction occurred P < 0.01). concentrations ranged from 0 to 132 g CE kg-1 DM, but 75% of the accessions contained less than 40 g CE kg-1 DM. For accessions appearing in the highest clusters, tannins decreased 40% at Columbia and 27% at Mt. Vernon from July to September. Accessions from Ethiopia contained an average of 100 g CE kg-1 DM and usually appeared in the highest clusters.

TI THE IN-VITRO ACTIVITY OF VERNONIA-AMYGDALINA ON LEISHMANIA-AETHIOPICA
SO ETHIOPIAN MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA English
DT Article
AB Anti-leishmanial activity or chloroform and methanol extracts of Vernonia amygdalina, a plant widely used in Ethiopia for the treatment of parasitic infections, has been assessed in vitro on Leishmania aethiopica. Amastigotes were more sensitive to V. amygdalina than promastigotes. The chloroform extract had a stronger parasiticidal activity, with median effective doses (ED50) of 18.5 mug/ml and 13.3 mug/ml for promastigotes and amastigotes, than the methanol extract with ED50 of 74.4 mug/ml and 45.8 mug/ml respectively. Cytotoxicity caused by V. amygdalina to host cells, the human leukaemia monocyte THP-1 cell line, as determined by the methyl tetrazolium assay, resulted in a median lethal dose (LD50) of 19.6 mug/ml for the chloroform extract and 243.4 mug/ml for the methanol extract. In comparison, the ED50 and LD50 of pentamidine, a standard anti-leishmanial drug, were 0.5 mug/ml and 1.4 mug/ml respectively. These results indicate that V. amygdalina displays potent anti-leishmanial activities and warrants further investigation.

AB The effect of applying vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) fungi or chopped roots of native plants to a standard, non-sterile nursery soil was investigated in a tree nursery in Ethiopia. Acacia abyssinica and Acacia sieberiana were grown for 3 and 4 months, respectively, in five different soils: standard nursery soil, soil inoculated with a tropical or with a temperate isolate of the VAM fungus Glomus mosseae, and soil inoculated with chopped roots of native forest plants or of grasses. Inoculation with both kinds of native roots and with the tropical G. mosseae isolate increased the shoot dry weight of A. sieberiana significantly, by 48, 33 and 36%, respectively, compared with seedlings in the standard soil. Inoculation with native forest roots and the tropical G. mosseae increased the shoot dry weight of A. abyssinica by 23 and 38%. The temperate isolate of G. mosseae did not improve the growth of either acacia species significantly. Growth stimulation was accompanied by a significantly higher mycorrhizal colonization in all cases except one, whereas shoot phosphorus and magnesium uptakes were generally not significantly affected.
   The survival of the A. abyssinica seedlings 6 months after their transfer from the nursery to the field was enhanced by all inoculations, although significantly so only with the tropical VAM isolate. The root dry weight after 18 months in the field was also improved in this treatment. The results demonstrate that application of a simple inoculum consisting of chopped roots of native plants with naturally occurring VAM fungi can be equally effective in enhancing seedling growth in tree nurseries in the tropical region as the more elaborate use of pure cultures of VAM fungi, both when seedlings are amply watered and when they are drought-stressed.

AB Vegetation changes in Sahel have been pardy explained by overgrazing. Some authors have queried the importance of herbivory as a cause of succession in arid areas, but this requires a differentiation between life-forms. In this study abundances of phanerophytes and chamaephytes were estimated on 30 hills on an arid mountain plateau in eastern Sahel, influenced by mist from the Red Sea. Their relative abundances were compared with a similar study in 1953 when the area was partly protected against browsing. Significant spatial and temporal trends were found by ordination techniques. Succession from an open woodland to a very open shrubland was revealed. Hardwood trees suitable for fuel and other plants of direct commercial value decreased. Plants with small, sclerophyllous leaves, and/or toxic chemicals increased. The changes are attributed to an increased human population and intensified browsing. These biotic factors interacted with drought periods. Species that also grow in the surrounding Sahelian transition zone were relatively more stable than those with a disjunct distribution in the region, which occur in die area of more moist regional climate found in the Ethiopian highland.

AB A total of 315 extracts/fractions from 63 traditionally used Ethiopian plants were subjected to antimicrobial screening using known strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella gallinarum, Escherichia coli. Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Candida albicans. The agar plate well-diffusion method was used at a sample concentration of 1000 mug/ml; it was found that all of the plants showed activity against one or more of the microorganism(s). Direct aqueous extracts from six plants were found to be active against all of the test organisms. These findings confirm traditional therapeutic claims for aqueous dosage forms of these herbs. The relative susceptibility of the test organisms to the five types of extracts/fractions indicated a decreasing rank order of: S. aureus, P. aeruginosa. C. albicans, S. gallinarum, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. vulgaris.

AB Iron deficiency symptoms are observed on some genotypes of lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus) grown in calcareous soil. A germplasm collection of 3512 accessions originating from 18 countries was characterized for iron deficiency in a Calcic Rhodoxeralf soil at ICARDA, Tel Hadya, Syria in the 1979/80 season. At 105 days after sowing, 592 accessions, representing 16.9% of the collection, showed chlorosis symptoms characteristic of iron (Fe) deficiency. The Fe deficiency was verified by foliar application of Fe-chelate. Germplasm from different countries showed differences in iron deficiency, with those accessions exhibiting symptoms of iron deficiency mostly originating from relatively warm climates such as India (37.5% accessions showing Fe deficiency) and Ethiopia (30%). Populations from those Mediterranean countries where lentil originated (Syria and Turkey) exhibited Fe-deficiency symptoms only at very low frequencies. Fe-deficiency induced chlorosis was positively correlated with cold susceptibility. Fe chlorosis was transient, the deficiency symptoms largely disappearing during reproductive growth at a time, coinciding with increases in soil temperature and daylength - conditions favorable for plant growth. In Indian germplasm, mild deficiency symptoms did not lead to reduced seed yield, but there was a major yield reduction of 47% in those accessions with the most severe symptoms. Straw yields was reduced commensurately with the severity of symptoms.

AB The present study deals with the effect of one of the traditionally used Ethiopian medicinal plants, Bersama abyssinica, on gut motility. The experiment was carried out on isolated guinea-pig ileum with a standard spasmogen, histamine, in the absence and presence of the water extract of the medicinal plant. The spasmogenic effect of histamine was found to be antagonized by the extract in a nonreversible manner, indicating that B. abyssinica has a spasmolytic activity.

DT Article
AB Digestibility in zebre (Equus burchelli Gray) and hertebeest (Acelaphus buselaphus Pall.) at Nechissar National Park (Ethiopia) measured from the ratio of indigestible inert elements in forage and feces varied considerably depending upon elements (Si, Fe, Mn, Al). The cause of the variability was the contamination of grazed forage with soil that was confirmed by the linear correlation of elemental concentration in feces and soil. The Fe deviated from the total correlation line that indicates the partial assimilation of iron in the intestine tract. The proportion of the elements concentrations in grazed forage, feces and soil was used for calculation of the soil addition to the consumed forage and the corrected coefficient of digestibility. Combination of Si-Al gives the result with the highest statistical confidence. Soil additions to consumed forage of zebra and hartebeest were correspondingly 1.4 and 2.9%, corrected digestibility was 37-47%. Concentration of used mineral elements in grazed forage is stable and independent of the plant phenology. Simplicity of elemental chemical analysis makes it possible to increase the number of samples and to obtain rather reliable estimates of the digestibility in free-ranging animals.

AB Sixty tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum L.) landrace agrotypes collected from the central highlands of Ethiopia and one commercial check cultivar (Boohai) were evaluated at Akaki experimental station for grain yield and 11 other component traits. The objectives were to estimate phenotypic (PCV) and genetic (GCV) coefficients of variation, broad-sense heritability (H) and genetic advance (GA), and to determine the interrelationships among the various traits. Genotypic differences among the agrotypes were highly significant for all the traits considered. Compared to Boohai, the landrace agrotypes were later in days-to-heading (DTH) and maturity (DTM), and had shorter grain filling period (GFP), lower fertility (KS) and lower 1000-kernel weight (TKW). By contrast, they were superior to Boohai in tiller number (TN), biological yield (BY) and grain yield plant(-1) (GYP). Intermediate to high order estimate combinations of GCV, H and GA (as % of the mean) were observed for TN, GYP, number of kernels spike(-1) (NKS), harvest index (HI) and TKW. GYP showed a moderate heritability which was higher than GFP, BY and Plant height (PHt). DTH and DTM were strongly correlated, but both were negatively associated with the rest of the traits except PHt. The negative correlation of DTM with GYP was largely indirect via other characters. PHt had either a weak or negative association with the other traits. TN and TKW were positively correlated with GYP, and had high and intermediate direct effects, respectively. These two traits, however, were negatively correlated and showed a substantial counter-balance effect via one another. It appears that, for the short-term, improvement of the Ethiopian wheat landraces may be possible through indirect selection for TN and TKW or direct selection for grain yield per se. In the long-run, crossing programmes between indigenous and introduced germplasm may be necessary.

AB Two hundred and three site specific pure line agrotypes, derived from 2000 entries of ten tetraploid wheat (Triticum turgidum) landrace populations collected at four localities in the central highlands of Ethiopia, were evaluated for three years at their respective sites of collection (Cheffe Donsa, Bichena) and at Akaki and Debre Zeit. At each site three adjacent yield trials corresponding to the three seed colours of brown, white, and purple, as found among the landraces were conducted. There were statistically significant differences for yield, 1000-kernel weight, days to heading and days to maturity between agrotypes within each trial group at all sites. Statistically significant differences for plant height were also observed in most of the trial groups. The agrotype x year interactions were statistically significant for 1000-kernel weight, days to heading and days to maturity within each trial group while they varied with test site for yield and plant height. No significant correlations were observed between yield and 1000-kernel weight in most of the trial groups. On the other hand, correlations between other agronomic traits varied with trial groups and test sites. Pure line agrotypes that have significantly outyielded the local check at the respective collection sites have been identified for use by farmers in those localities or for further improvement of the landraces.

AB Although lablab (Lablab purpureus L.) is grown in many parts of Africa relatively little investigation has been done on its adaptation to acid soils, which are generally low in available P. In the present study, lablab was evaluated for tolerance to acidity and low available P on two Ethiopian soils. The two soils were a Nitosol (Soddo soil) and a clay loam with 77% Al saturation (Chencha soiI). The pH of the Soddo soil unlimed was 4.8 and 5.6 when limed and with 0 and 37.5 mg P/kg soil applied at each lime rate. The treatments on the Chencha soil were pH 4.1 and 5.9 with combinations 0 and 25 mg P/kg added.
   There were highly significant (P<0.01) differences between the mean shoot and root dry matter yields and the shoot/root ratios of the lablab accessions on the two soils as well as plant height on the Chencha soil. The mean shoot and root dry matter yields were increased by liming alone by 14 and 23%, while P application increased growth by 8 and 12%, respectively. Lime and P together suppressed mean root yields. On the Chencha soil, lime increased shoot and root yields by 87 and 35%, and by 59 and 14% with P added, respectively, while P alone increased growth by 28 and 17% with little effect on the limed soil.
   Lablab could be screened for differential performance using mean dry matter yields on both soils but screening for varying levels of acidity and P was reliable only with root yield on the Soddo soil and plant height on the Chencha soil.

   YIELD-LOSS ASSESSMENT
AB In a survey for viruses of cultivated legumes in West Asia and North Africa, pea seed-borne mosaic virus (PSbMV) was found in faba bean, lentil and pea. Using ELISA, it was detected in 107 out of 1554 faba bean samples and 40 out of 496 lentil samples with virus-like symptoms collected in Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia and Turkey.
   A pea isolate (SP9-88) from Syria was further characterized. Out of 57 plant species tested, 35 were found susceptible, 19 of which are newly reported hosts of the virus. The virus was transmitted efficiently in the non-persistent manner by five aphid species, especially Myzus persicae. Purification from systemically infected faba bean plants yielded 10-15 mg of purified virus per kg of infected tissue. Sap-inoculation of the food and forage legume species chickpea, faba bean, lentil, pea, Vicia narbonensis, V. sativa, Lathyrus ochrus and L. sativus at flowering stage led to 66.0, 40.5, 44.6, 49.2, 31.7, 7.5, 35.7 and 12.0% yield loss, respectively, and to seed-transmission rates of 0.7, 6.0, 10.8, 1.1, 0.3, 0.2 and 0.4%, respectively. No transmission was detected in chickpea seed embryo axes. However, the virus was detected in the seed coat of PSbMV-infected chickpea at an estimated rate of 1.81%.

AB Changes in nutritional values with plant development were studied in lucerne (Medicago saliva L. cv. Hairy peruvian) at Kulumsa in Ethiopia during four growing seasons in 1985-87.
   As estimated by linear regression equations the content of crude protein (CP) and the in vitro organic matter digestibility (IVOMD) declined at the rates of 0.12 and 0.14 percentage units per day, respectively, due to advance in plant development during the four growing seasons.
   Neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF) and lignin increased at the rates of 0.16, 0.06 and 0.03 percentage units per day, respectively. NDF was more negatively correlated to IVOMD than ADF and lignin.
   The contents of total ash, K, P and Mg declined significantly with advancing plant development, but no consistent trends were observed for Ca and Na. At advanced stages of development, contents of P and Mg dropped below the required critical levels.
   Because of high losses of leaves, delayed harvesting of lucerne beyond the bud stage would result in lower total yield of nutrients.

DT Article
AB The nutritive value and digestibility of food of six species of wild herbivorous mammals (Loxodonta africana, Aselaphus bulcelaphus, Damaliscus korrigum, Ourebia ourebi, Redunca redunca, Tragelaphus scriptum) were investigated in the South-West Ethiopia natural savanna during dry season (November 1986-February 1987). Digestibility of food and nutrients was measured indirectly by ratio technique with Fe internal indicator. In dry season free-ranging animals consumed the green aftergrass and the new leaves of trees, regenerated after burning. Forage plants had a low level of protein (5,6%). In the rumen of ruminants the concentration of the nitrogen increased 2-3 times: 50% of soluble carbohydrates (F.N.E.) were utilized. The composition of food in the elephant stomach did not change. The digestibility of dry matter was 60% (in ruminants) and 51% (in elephant). Digestibility of lipids, protein, fibre, and F.N.E. corresponded with other data for African mammals.

   SCREENING; VARIETAL VARIATION
AB A total of 1315 barley cultivars originating from various regions of the world were tested for their resistance to scald (Rhynchosporium secalis (OUD.) DAVIS). Screening of the resistant cultivars was conducted by the application of two testing methods consisting of natural inoculation for the mature plants and artificial inoculation for the seedlings. In both tests, the disease reaction on a plant was classified into three types as follows; highly resistant (R), moderately resistant (M) and susceptible (S) reactions. In the field test for mature plants, 79 cultivars were found to be R and most of them were of Ethiopian and Turkish origin. There were only a few resistant cultivars of East Asian origin (Table 2). In the artificial inoculation test for the seedlings, 48 cultivars showed a highly resistant reaction, almost all of them being of Ethiopian and Turkish origin (Table 3). No cultivars with a R reaction were found in the East Asian materials. Finally, 17 cultivars were confirmed to be resistant in both tests for the mature plants and seedlings (Table 4). It was concluded that these 17 cultivars could become useful as genetic resources for resistance to scald.

DT Article
DE MAIZE; LIMING; P-UPTAKE; TROPICAL SOILS
AB The effects of liming in improving the availability of phosphate from soil and applied mono-calcium phosphate was investigated on two acid soils of Ethiopia (Nitosol from Bako and Adet, pH(KCl) 4.4) in comparison to an acid soil from Germany (Gleyed Gray Brown Luvisol from Pettenbrunn, pH(KCl) 4.0). Maize served as a test crop.
   The application of lime to Pettenbrunn soil significantly decreased the plant P-uptake. Whereas its application to Adet and Bako soil gave no significant response. In Pettenbrunn soil, P x lime interaction was positive for dry matter yield and negative for P-uptake, whereas it was negative for both P-uptake and dry matter yield in Adet as well as in Bako soil. The yield depressing effect of lime was more obvious and significant in Adet than in Bako soil. The response of the available-P content of the soil to lime was positive in Adet and Bako soil, but not in Pettenbrunn soil.
   Additional application of Mg or Zn to both lime and lime + P treated soils had no effect on the dry matter yield, implying that the observed yield depression was not caused by lime induced Mg or Zn deficiencies.
   The addition of lime had altered the contents of the different P fractions. In all the soils, all the inorganic P-forms, except Ca-P, increased substantially. In Bako and Adet soils, lime when accompained with phosphate applications had no effect on any of the P fractions. Whereas in Pettenbrunn soil it increased the content of water soluble Fe-P and Al-P fractions.
   No significant response of dry matter yield and P-uptake of maize was obtained to residual lime in all the three soils.

AB A forest in the Harerge highlands representing the forests that used to cover all the highland areas of southeastern Ethiopia was studied. It is dominated by Juniperus procera and Podocarpus gracilior which are associated with several broad-leaved tree species. The forest is important for its productive and protective functions as well as for conserving both plant and animal diversity for future uses. However, like many other tropical forests, it is under increased human pressure. As a result, some of the species such as Olea hochstetteri, Hagenia abyssinica, and Juniperus procera are under threat of extinction from the area. The problems associated with human impact are discussed and recommendations that may help to alleviate these problems are presented.

AB The gene v controlls the number of kernel rows in the spike, i. e. the presence or absence of awns on lateral spikelets and their fertility, and is completely linked with the functionally related lk locus on chromosome 2. The Lk allele suppresses the development of awns at all spikelets. The F1 of the cross of two-rowed, awnless barleys (VV LkLk) with six-rowed, awned ones (vv lklk) has as a rule intermediate, short-awned spikes. However, after crossing the Ethiopian barleys, Grannenlose Zweizeilige, Ab 6 and E.P. 79, with Line 152, three exceptional F1 plants (6,1 %) were found, with medium length to long awns. Such recombinant phenotypes appear already in F1 and arise also in the heterozygote class of F2 and F3. The unexpected occurrence of two-rowed, long-awned recombinants, but not of six-rowed, awnless ones, indicates non-reciprocal events in the v-lk region. It is assumed that gene conversion of Lk to lk or v to V, respectively, occurs in the mitosis of somatic cells of heterozygous plants. The chimeric nature of several plants, which probably also causes the observed aberrant ratios, supports this assumption. That needs indeed a high frequency of mitotic chromsosome pairing which is likely promoted by crosses with Line 152 and seems also to be influenced by growing conditions.

AB Nineteen different tick species have been identified in Western Ethiopia. The most important ticks belong to the genera Amblyomma, Boophilus, Hyalomma and Rhipicephalus, while the major cattle tick-borne diseases are anaplasmosis, babesiosis and theileriosis, T. mutans.
   Dipping, hand spraying and spray races for ticks are only practised in the state dairy farms where cross-bred cattle are kept. The main acaricide in use is the chlorinated hydrocarbon, toxaphene. Flumethrin bayticol pour-on is now being used to a limited degree on dairy cattle. Traditional tick control methods which include hand-picking and the application of plant preparations are widely used on indigenous cattle.

AB On a Vertisol under 850 mm rainfall, at an altitude of 1850 m, Faidherbia albida trees that occurred at 6.52 trees ha-1, with a canopy cover that ranged from 97 m2 ha-1 to 229 m2 ha-1 were recorded. Studies on the lateral and vertical influence of the tree canopy on some physical and chemical properties of the soil, show apparent higher organic matter on the West side of the tree than the East due to accumulated wind blown litter by prevalent wind direction, and organic matter, N, P and K levels were higher under the tree canopy than outside for all directions and depths studied. Soil pH, exchangeable Na, Ca and Mg under the canopy and outside were similar. Available water capacity was 1.5 to 2 times more under than outside the tree. Noticeable increases in the silt fraction under the tree was recorded and discussed in relation to soil condition improvement and plant growth.

AB A set of 840 pure line faba beans (Vicia faba L) derived by a process of cyclic single plant selection from 1979 to 1985 was used for this study. Mean content of protein was 240 g kg-1 with a standard deviation of 18 g kg-1 and a range of 180 to 310 g kg-1. For eight subregional groups (Nile Valley, West Asia, Northern Europe, Southern Europe, Eastern Europe, North Africa, Ethiopia and the Indian subcontinent) and for a large and small grouping, the means and ranges of protein content were similar. There were no significant correlations between protein content and seed yield or its components. This resulted in a strong correlation (significant at P < 0.01) between seed yield and protein yield (r = 0.98), supporting the hypothesis that the optimal way to increase sustainable protein yield per hectare is to increase and stabilise seed yield.

TI PROGRESS ACHIEVED BY BREEDING OPEN-POLLINATED CULTIVARS AS COMPARED WITH

DT Article
ID PHYSIOLOGICAL-CHANGES
AB To assess the progress made in modern breeding of open-pollinated sorghum cultivars, 24 contemporary and improved sorghum cultivars from ICRISAT (International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics, India) were compared with 40 sorghum landraces collected in Ethiopia.  The experiment was performed at Bet Dagan, Israel, in 1988 under near-potential (drip-irrigated) and dryland (stored soil moisture) growing conditions.  Data on phenology, biomass, harvest index, grain yield and its components were collected.  'Drought susceptibility index' (S) was calculated for each genotype as the reduction in yield from irrigated to dryland conditions relative to the mean reduction for all genotypes.
   On average, cultivars produced about three- to fourfold more grain than landraces.  Cultivars had the same mean growth duration and biomass but were 40% (irrigated) to 27% (dryland) shorter in mean plant height than landraces.  This yield advantage was fully accounted for by a proportionately greater mean kernel number per panicle and harvest index, irrespective of the water regime.  'Drought susceptibility index' was near average for all cultivars and much more variable among landraces.  Dryland yield became progressively dependent on the yield potential as the yield potential was genetically improved in the cultivars.
   It was concluded that, irrespective of the water regime, the large yield improvement in modern open-pollinated cultivars of sorghum, as compared with landraces, has been achieved only through greater dry matter partitioning to the panicle accompanied by a reduction in plant height.  The genetic improvement of yield in open-pollinated cultivars and hybrids of sorghum is discussed.

AB Genetic improvement of crop plants for drought resistance is hindered by lack of information on variability and associations of drought-response characters in breeding materials. We evaluated 3430 accessions in a world collection of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L. var. durum) for 19 characters under severe moisture-limiting field conditions at Swift Current, SK, Canada in 1984. Phenotypic diversity (H) and multicharacter associations were investigated in germplasm from nine durum wheat growing regions. The Middle East was one of the regions with a high level of diversity (H = 1.272), while Ethiopia had the lowest level of diversity (H = 1.132). The rate of excised-leaf water loss (RWL) was used as a possible indicator of drought resistance. Glaucousness, plant height, chlorotic leaf spots, days to flowering, and days to maturity were significantly associated with RWL in six to seven regions. The discrete multivariate log-linear analysis involving these six characters revealed the first order (two-character) and some second-order (three-character) associations. These five characters were chosen along with RWL as drought-response characters that may be useful for establishing selection criteria for drought resistance. These results have important implications for developing durum wheat ideotypes for high and stable production in drought-prone environments.

AB Photosynthetic flexibility and water use efficiency of Kalanchoe petitiana A. Rich., a facultative CAM plant endemic to the highlands of Ethiopia, were investigated to determine the physiological determinants for the ecological success of the plant.  Both field measurements of delta-C-13 and greenhouse gas exchange studies showed a shift from C3 photosynthesis to CAM as leaves aged or at the onset of water stress.  Recycling of CO2 was observed in developing leaves without concomitant net CO2 uptake.  Accumulation of malate was positively correlated with increased cell sap osmolality and improved daily water use efficiency.  The importance of flexibility in carbon uptake pathway and of recycling CO2 for the ecological success of the plant is discussed.

DT Article
AB Trials were conducted in 1987 and 1988 to test methods of intercropping annual Ethiopian clovers, Trifolium spp, with wheat. Several different clover varieties, sowing methods, plant spacings, planting dates and rates of phosphorus application were compared. Planting in single or double alternative rows 20 cm apart did not affect wheat grain and straw yield but broadcast sowing of Trifolium in wheat rows 20 cm apart reduced wheat yield. The Trifolium species used significantly affected legume yield. Phosphorus fertilizer increased yield significantly, especially that of the legume component. The trials indicated that the intercropping of Ethiopian clovers in wheat has potential under African highland conditions.

DE LENTIL; ASCOCHYTA BLIGHT; CONTROL IN ETHIOPIA
AB An Ascochyta sp. was consistently isolated from ascochyta blight-affected lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) seed and plants. The fungus was pathogenic only to lentil and not to any of seven other legume species tested. Based on the cultural and morphological characteristics, pathogenicity and host range tests the causal fungus was identified as Ascochyta lentis Vassilievsky. The symptoms of the disease on lentil leaves, stems and pods are necrotic lesion speckled with brownish pycnidia. The seed-borne nature of the fungus was confirmed. In a 3-year field trial, chlorothalonil (Bravo 500), benomyl (Benlate) and a mixture of tridemorph and maneb (Calixin M) provided the best disease control and highest yields. The hot-water and dry-heat treatments at 55-degrees-C for 25 min and 70-degrees-C for 24 h gave partial inhibited fungal growth from seed. None of the 139 accessions tested was immune; 35 were identified as resistant, whereas the remainder were moderately resistant to susceptible. Seed transmission of the fungus varied in different genotypes according to their resistance reaction.

AB The inheritance of resistance to an isolate of Albugo candida collected from Brassica carinata in Ethiopia was investigated using two Brassica napus lines.  All 33 F1 plants derived from two crosses between the resistant line 2282-9 and the susceptible line DHF86-36 showed a resistant reaction.  The segregation ratio of 3 resistant:  1 susceptible in the F2 generation suggests that resistance of 2282-9 to the B. carinata isolate is conditioned by a single dominant resistance gene.  This was confirmed when progenies derived from the backcross between F1 plants and the susceptible parent segregated in a 1:1 ratio for resistance and susceptibility.  The results are discussed in the context of the relationships between genotypes of Brassica species and races and isolates of A. candida.

AB Because of the partially insect cross-pollinated nature of faba bean (Vicia faba L.), ICARDA maintains two types of faba bean germplasm collections. The ILB (International Legume Faba Bean) collection consists of the original germplasm accessions as received, usually heterogeneous and heterozygous. From this another collection of faba bean pure lines (BPL) has been derived through a process of cyclic single plant progeny selection. The frequency distributions of eight (stipule spot pigmentation, leaflet size, lodging, intensity of streaks, pod angle/attitude, pod shape, pod color at maturity, and seed shape) of 22 discretely scored descriptors showed significant variation. Other descriptors tended to follow the normal scores associated with the cultivated varieties of the ICARDA region. For the eight descriptors with sufficient variation, frequency distributions were calculated separately for eight regional groupings (the Nile Valley, West Asia, North Europe, southern Europe, eastern Europe, North Africa, Ethiopia and the Indian subcontinent). The most important regional variation was smaller leaflet sizes in West Asia and northern and southern Europe, and higher susceptibility to lodging in Ethiopia. Pod and seed descriptor regional variation closely followed known preferences for seed size and pod length which are based on different regional uses of faba bean.

   On the basis of estimates of soluble carbohydrate, sucrose, protein and free amino acid contents in the anthers, it was concluded that the metabolic activities of the anthers obtained from the fertile plant were substantially higher than those of the anthers from the male-sterile accessions.  The amino acid composition estimated for the material collected three days before flowering varied appreciably from that detected in the material from the first harvesting on the sixth day.  In this respect, by flowering time serine was found to have accumulated to the greatest extent in the fertile variety and in the male-sterile C2154-2, and to have decreased in C2018-8.  In addition, serine was found to be the amino acid that always accumulated to the largest extent in the anthers, regardless of the coffee plant variety.  Proline accumulation followed the same pattern and was second to serine in terms of amount accumulated, also decreasing drastically in C2018-8 at flowering time.  A similar behavior was observed for glutamic acid and ammonium nitrogen.

AB Shrubland vegetation and environmental data in western Shewa, Ethiopia have been analysed.  Vegetation data include cover-abundance values of vascular plant species; environmental data comprise physical and chemical properties of the soil, altitude, slope, grazing and browsing pressure.
   The vegetation data were subjected to hierarchical and non-hierarchical classification and ordination with correspondence analysis.  The classification resulted in seven different vegetation types, ranging from grassland with scattered shrubs to degenerated forest.  Ordination of the data and biplot analysis showed that the vegetation is influenced by anthropogenic factors and altitudinal variation.  Sand content is related to a low level of anthropogenic influence whereas silt content is related to a high level.  This is explained by historical events rather than by the present situation.  Total nitrogen, organic carbon, altitude and slope are positively correlated and these variables are negatively related to anthropogenic influences.
   The shrubland vegetation may have expanded from lower altitudes and drier sites as forests gradually disappeared.
   The recovery of an economically more rewarding vegetation type may be achieved through providing alternative sources of fuel and construction and through prohibiting cultivation and grazing in the shrublands on the hillsides.  Regeneration can be accelerated by actively introducing seedlings of tree species that do not need a heavy canopy cover for establishment and growth.

AB Surveys carried out during two seasons showed that the bean fly (BF), Ophiomyia phaseoli (Tyron), is widely distributed in Ethiopa.  It was found on haricot beant (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) and soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) but caused economic damage only on haricot bean.  The leguminous bush Crotalaria laburnifolia L. was the only wild host plant supporting BF and its parasitoids throughout the year in some parts of Ethiopia.  These surveys confirmed that Ophiomyia phaseoli is the only species of bean fly found in this country.
   Bean fly incidence on the wild host was highest during the dry season, between December and March.  Seventeen species of parasitoids were recorded.  Of these, the pteromalids Sphegigaster stepicola Bouc. and S. brunneicornis (Ferr.) were the most common species on the wild plant host, accounting for up to 44.5 % (xBAR = 26.2 +/- 3.1 %; xBAR +/- se) of BF parasitism.  Parasitism by the braconid Opius phaseoli Fischer was low, ranging from 0 % to 23.2 % (xBAR = 5.6 +/- 1.3 %).  However, on haricot bean, it was the major parasitoid, with over 87 % of BF parasitism.  This fact suggests the possibility that the host plant plays an important role in BF dynamics.

TI GENETIC-ASPECTS OF THE COFFEE TREE
SO REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE GENETICA
LA Portuguese
DT Article
AB Genetic analysis of coffee (Coffea arabica) has been undertaken in the Genetics Department of the Instituto Agronomico de Campinas since 1933 to better understand the inheritable variability within the species, for genetics and breeding purposes.  Initially, the main characteristics of C. arabica cultivars were analysed.  Afterwards, factors affecting charcters of economic importance, such as plant height and yield potential and more recently, factors related to disease resistance and adverse environmental conditions were studied.
   Gradually, a C. arabica, germoplasm bank, i.e. a living collection, was established with land races, new cultivars, deviant types found in nurseries and farms, as well as acessions of native germoplasm from Ethiopia, the center of origin or diversification of this species.  Other Coffea species and related genera were also assembled, though not so extensively.
   In this paper we present an updated review of the genetic analysis already published, with additional information on mutants not hitherto mentioned.  We also discuss aspects of taxonomy, cytology and phylogenetic relationships of C. arabica with diploid species.  The primitive Arabica cultivar, botanically described as C. arabica var typica was used as the standard type in all genetic analysis, allowing the establishment of dominance relationships, epistasis and pleiotropic effects.
   The relationship of the Arabica and Bourbon cultivars was established.  The dominant T allele is present in the Arabica cultivar (TT NaNa), while the higher yielding Bourbon has the alleles tt NaNa.  Crosses of mutants with Murta plants (tt Nana) indicate their relationship either to Arabica or to Bourbon primitive cultivars.
   We also studied factors affecting the color of young leaves, fruits and seeds, fasciation of the polysperma cultivar, presence and associated characteristics of mutants with developed sepals in the ripe fruit, leaf shape and size, orientation of plagiotropic branches, flowering habit, size and shape of the trees and defective seed endosperm development.  Detailed investigations were done with the so called laurina mutants (1r1r).  Besides halving the caffeine content of the seeds, this factor has a strong pleiotropic effect of the shape of the plant, fruit, seed and length of lateral branches.  Factors controlling resistance to leaf rust disease (H. vastatrix), bacterial blight (Pseudomonas syringae pv garceae), coffee berry disease (Colletotrichum coffeanum), nematodes (Meloidogyne exigua) and leaf miner (Perileucoptera coffella) were also investigated, emphasizing their importance in the breeding program.
   Although millions of plants have been carefully checked in nurseries and farms, in search for new variants, only a few were found in the last decades, probably due to the tetraploid nature of the species.  Attempts to use physical and chemical mutagens to increase the number of variants were unsuccessfull.
   As in other perennial crops, genetic analysis in coffee takes years to be accomplished, and it is expensive.  This explains the scarcity of data from other research centers.
   Some factors such as maragogipe, mokka and fasciation affect various characteristics.  Other seem to have the effect restricted to a single trait like the allele cera which, in triple dosage, changes the normal green endosperm to waxy coloured, or erecta that determines an upright orientation of the lateral branches.  The four main short structure factors reduce internode length and as a consequence plant height.  Caturra (Ct), Sao Bernardo (Sb), Vila Lobos (Vl) and San Ramon (Sr) are dominant, independently inherited and interact with each other in dihybrid combinations in a typical duplicate dominant epistasis, the presence of one dominant allele at one locus masking the effect of the other.  Caturra (Ct) was transferred to high yielding cultivars to reduce costs of manual and to facilitate mechanical harvesting.
   The cera factor proved to be an invaluable marker to determine the ontogenetic origin of the tissue that forms the seeds as true endosperm.  Also due to the xenia effect, it allowed fast and convenient evaluation of the degree of cross pollination under natural conditions.  The erecta factor, by reducing the canopy diameter, permits close spacings in the field, allowing for higher plant densities.
   Genetic factors controlling the resistance to leaf rust disease were mainly found in C. arabica acessions and in selected C. canephora lines.  They have been transferred to commercial cultivars, resulting in new resistant germoplasms such as Icatu, Catimor, Colombia and others.  Icatu coffee is of particular value to Brazilian coffee producing regions due to its rusticity, high yield and non-specific resistance to the pathogen.
   The determination of the genetics of resistance to coffee berry disease has provided the basis for the development of resistant cultivars, of utmost importance to consumers since chemicals are normally sprayed throughout the fruit development cycle for controlling the disease.  Resistance to nematodes and to leaf miner present respectively in C. canephora and C. racemosa are being transferred to C. arabica and such interspecifically derived germoplasms look very promising.
   Though not many coffee genetic factors have been characterized so far, their study has proved to be of great value for assisting coffee breeding programs and undoubtedly provide a significant improvement in our knowledge of the coffee tree.

AB An efficient tissue culture system for high frequency of plant regeneration from hypocotyl explants of Brassica carinata was developed via manipulation of culture medium and selection of explants.  Explants grown on medium containing combinations of 2 mg l-1 BA and 0.01 mg l-1 NAA or 4 mg l-1 kinetin and 0.01 mg l-1 2,4-D regenerated shoots at 100% frequency.  High frequency shoot regeneration occurred only from explants originating from 6 to 7-day-old but not younger or older seedlings.  Explants showed higher regeneration capacity at the distal end than the proximal end, and the upper segment was more regenerative than the lower segment of hypocotyl.  Regenerants were rooted on half-strength growth regulator-free medium, acclimatized and developed into normal, fertile plants.

AB The effects of different P levels on the growth and N and P nutrition of 20 accessions from eleven Ethiopian clover (Trifolium) species were investigated in a glasshouse.  The treatments were 0, 12.5, 25, 37.5, and 50 mg P/kg.  Shoot and root dry matter yields plus N and P concentrations in the shoots were subjected to a numerical classification in order to simplify description and interpretation of the results.  The classification separated the accessions into four main groups.  These groups ranged from one which had accesions with low yield and low response to P to one which had accessions with high yield and high response to P.  The most responsive group had also high uptake and utilization of N and P, but relatively low N and P concentrations in plant tops and low shoot/root ratios.  Accessions in the two highest yielding groups responded to each increment in the P rate while accessions in the least responsive group did not respond to fertilizer above 12.5 mg P/kg.  The fourth group had intermediate response between these extremes.

AB Eight chemical methods were employed for estimating the available P in 32 Ethiopian soils using phasey bean (Macroptilium lathyroides c.v. Murray) as a test crop grown in small pots in a glasshouse and the soil test values then correlated with plant characteristics.  Olsen's method gave the highest correlation with percentage yield and P uptake in all three cuts and also was the most reliable giving 97% correct predictions.  Warren and Cooke, and Truog methods were the next most useful methods.  The critical levels of available soil P for the three methods below which response to P fertilizer would be expected on the soils were 8.5, 48 and 215 ppm P, respectively.  The Egner method was the least useful of all the methods for estimating available P from the soils.  Olsen, Warren and Cooke, Truog methods are tentatively recommended for use in routine analysis for P in Ethiopian soils until regional field experiments are established to define the superior chemical methods.

Among 60 plant families recorded Poaceae, Fabaceae and Asteraceae are by far the species richest taxa.  A total of 444 species was recorded and the 204 species with a minimum relative steadiness of 2% were examined synecologically, employing monofactorial gradient analyses.  Thirteen site factors were investigated and for nine of them indicator values were denominated.  Diversity of the flora varied between 6 and 59 (xBAR = 28.5) and is mainly determined by natural factors (especially altitude, soil group, relief).  Among the anthropogenic factors the semipermanent cropping pattern (i.e. rotation of fallow and annual crop production) is of high significance for species diversity.  Site factors of overriding importance for species composition are altitude, Ca-saturation, soil-pH and soil texture.  Compared to herbaceous plants grassy species (Cyperaceae, Juncaceae, Poaceae) are less sensitive to the four key factors identified.  An outstanding affinity towards low soil-pH levels was identified for members of the Caryophyllaceae, Oxalidaceae and Polygonaceae.  The two latter facts are confirmed and causally supported by results of literature.  Findings of the synecological analysis have been included in the sociological structure of the agrestal flora.  Leading species were selected for the denomination of class, suborders, orders and associations.

AB Flag leaf in wheat (Triticum spp.) is a major source of photosynthate for the developing grain and its size contributes to interplant competition.  Flag leaf length, width, and area in a sample of 778 entries of durum wheat (T. turgidum L. durum group) germplasm obtained from the U.S. National Small Grains Collection showed considerable phenotypic variation.  Correlations between flag leaf and eight spike quantitative characters showed significant values greater than 0.30 for kernel weight per spike with all three flag leaf measurements and for awn length with flag leaf length and area.  Larger flag leaf area appeared to be associated with accessions having a history of some deliberate plant breeding for high grain yield.  A multivariate approach was used to assess how discrimination among 26 countries of origin obtained with spike characters in a previous study was affected by reducing the sample size from about 3,000 to 735 and by the addition of flag leaf measurements to the analysis.  The reduced sample size had little impact on the results of the previous analysis on the whole collection of about 3,000 entries.  The addition of flag leaf characters to the analysis caused a rearrangement in the clusters of countries, mostly from Asia, where less germplasm modified by plant breeding was included in the collection.  Five clusters were identified:  (1) 11 Mediterranean basin countries, (2) USA, UdSSR, and Yugoslavia, (3) four Near East Countries and Bulgaria, (4) three Middle East countries and Greece, India and Ethiopia, and (5) Afghanistan.  Phenotypic differentiation of durum wheat, and probably many other crops, on a geographic basis is more pronounced in areas where plant breeding has had little impact.

AB Reciprocal crosses were made between 9 different barley genotypes with high genetic variability for net blotch resistance.  Parents and 72 F1 plants were used to determine the inheritance of partial resistance to net blotch.  Four experiments, one in a growth chamber on seedlings and 3 others in the field on adult plants, were undertaken using a randomised complete block design.  An isolate of net blotch from local cultivars was used for inoculation.  Non-inoculated plants of one of the field experiments were used for the detached leaf test in petri dishes.
   Results show that the cultivars 'Banteng', and 'Arrivate', the Ethiopian line CI 5791, and the Syrian line 79 SIO-10, had a high partial resistance in all experiments.  Diallel analysis showed high significant general and specific combining ability when maternal and reciprocal effects were not significant.  As the resistance genotypes have a high additive genetic effect, they could be successfully used for breeding purposes.

TI The effect of different virus isolates on the expression of tolerance to
   barley yellow dwarf virus in barley
SO ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB A barley variety of Ethiopian origin, with a single Mendelian gene confering tolerance to barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV), was equally tolerant to a number of isolates of the virus, whereas a susceptible European barley was more susceptible to isolates transmitted by Rhopalosiphum padi L. than to those transmitted by Macrosiphum (Sitobion) avenae (Fab). However, hybrids between these two varieties homozygous for the Ethiopian tolerance gene were more tolerant to 'mild' than to 'severe' isolates, irrespective of the vector specificity. The European variety was damaged more severely by all isolates when infected early than when infected late in its development, but the hybrids were damaged more severely by M. avenae-transmitted isolates when infected late.
   It is suggested that in susceptible plants the concentration, rather than the virulence, of the virus determines disease severity, whereas the reverse is true in plants possessing a gene which reduces virus multiplication. Virus concentration appears to determine the severity of R. padi-transmitted isolates, while virulence determines the severity of M. avenae-transmitted isolates. The latter would also seem to be adapted towards late infection.

TI Inheritance and effectiveness of genes in barley that condition

SO ANNALS OF APPLIED BIOLOGY
LA English
DT Article
AB Tolerance to barley yellow dwarf virus (BYDV) in five Ethiopian barley genotypes was conditioned by major genes which apparently occurred at, or near, the same chromosome locus in each genotype. The genes or alleles differed in effectiveness, one providing a high, three an intermediate and one a low level of tolerance. In plants having a slow rate of growth, the effectiveness of the tolerance genes tended to be masked, but the effectiveness of the gene or allele which provided the highest level of tolerance was masked to a lesser extent than that of genes or alleles providing low or intermediate levels of tolerance.
